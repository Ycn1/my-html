		what has gone attaching improvement or achieving success? Personally the best answer is that take action and be creative, just as the old saying goes 'Never go out there to see what happens go out there to make something happen'
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a case in point that Mathin Lucher King ,a renowned civil activist, Confronted with the racial discrimination in American,he didn't watch what happens,Instead he made something happen-oragniaed many nonviolent protest,and delivered some civil speeches,which indeeped help American win more rights and freedom.Great man do so,And our ordinary people shoule shick the ontion ,and do a dero in daily life,facing the urgent and pressng enviromental pollution,everyone should do a little to improvemrnt our inviroment rather than showing indifference.
	</p>
	<p>
		To sum up,doing and creating.compared with watching,have more of significance and value,Those who can put ideas into practice and be creating can reap achievement uitimately.
